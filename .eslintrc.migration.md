# ESLint Migration Notes

## Current Status

The ESLint and Prettier tooling has been set up for the project. As of the initial setup, there are **104 linting issues** (87 errors, 17 warnings) in the existing codebase.

## Why These Issues Exist

The codebase was developed before these tools were introduced. The existing code works correctly but doesn't yet conform to the style standards we've established.

## How to Address These Issues

### Automated Fixes

Many of these issues can be automatically fixed:

```bash
npm run lint:fix    # Auto-fix linting issues
npm run format      # Auto-format with Prettier
```

**Note**: These commands will modify ~45 files. It's recommended to:
1. Run these on a separate branch
2. Review the changes carefully
3. Test the extension after formatting
4. Commit the formatting changes separately from feature work

### Manual Review Required

Some issues require manual review:
- Unused variables (may indicate dead code or incomplete features)
- Duplicate class members (need careful refactoring)
- Logic that needs restructuring

## Recommended Approach

1. **For new code**: Always follow the linting rules from the start
2. **For existing code**: Fix issues incrementally as you work on files
3. **One-time cleanup**: Consider a dedicated PR to format the entire codebase

## Running Checks

```bash
# Check linting (doesn't modify files)
npm run lint

# Check formatting (doesn't modify files)
npm run format:check

# Run all checks
npm run validate
```

## Integration with Development Workflow

All contributors should run `npm run validate` before submitting PRs. This ensures:
- Code passes linting rules
- Code is properly formatted
- All tests pass
